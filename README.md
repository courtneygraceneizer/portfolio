A collection of my research projects in bioinformatics, genomics, and more!

### 🧬 Genome Analysis and Annotation of *Nakaseomyces nivariensis*  
📌 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/courtneygraceneizer/Nakaseomyces_Genome_Analysis) *(Coming Soon!)*  
📝 Overview: Performed de novo genome assembly and annotation of *Nakaseomyces nivariensis* using HPC and bioinformatics tools. Conducted sequence comparison and transcription factor analysis to identify homologous sequences and assess gene functionality.  


### scRNA-Seq Analysis with Seurat
📌 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/courtneygraceneizer/scRNA-seq_Seurat_Analysis)  
📝 Overview: I used Seurat in R to analyze single-cell RNA-Seq data from 10X Genomics, clustering immune cells based on gene expression. This project helped me understand how preprocessing choices impact cell type identification.

### ♻️ Trash-Bots: AI-Powered Environmental Efforts  
📌 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/courtneygraceneizer/Trash-Bots)  
📝 Overview: Collaborative web application utilizing AI to automate environmental issue detection and response. This project demonstrates an AI-driven approach to identifying and addressing environmental challenges through an interactive platform.

### scRNA-Seq Analysis with Seurat
📌 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/courtneygraceneizer/scRNA-seq_Seurat_Analysis)  
📝 Overview: I used Seurat in R to analyze single-cell RNA-Seq data from 10X Genomics, clustering immune cells based on gene expression. This project helped me understand how preprocessing choices impact cell type identification.
